# 🚀 Spring Boot Microservices Architecture

##  Overview
This project is a **fully functional Spring Boot microservices architecture** with key components such as service discovery, API gateway, authentication, monitoring, and containerization. It follows best practices to ensure **scalability, security, and observability** in a distributed system.

---

## 🛠️ Features
### 🔗 **Core Microservices**
- **API Gateway** (`api-gateway`): Centralized entry point for managing requests and authentication.
- **Service Discovery** (`discovery-server`): Uses **Netflix Eureka** for dynamic service registration and load balancing.
- **Business Services**:
  - `inventory-service`: Manages product inventory.
  - `order-service`: Handles order processing.
  - `product-service`: Manages product catalog.
  - `user-management`: Handles user authentication and authorization.


### 📡 **Monitoring & Observability**
- **Prometheus** (`prometheus`): Collects real-time system metrics and service performance.
- **Grafana**: Provides visual dashboards for monitoring service health.
- **Swagger UI** (`custom-swagger-ui.html`): API documentation and testing.
